Cells are Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming rods, 0.8–1×1–2 µm, that usually occur singly, in pairs or in short chains. 
Colonies on mMRS agar are circular, with entire margins, smooth, convex, white and approximately 1 mm in diameter after 2 days incubation at 30 °C. 
Arginine is not deaminated.
Can grow on mMRS agar supplemented with 5 % (w/v) NaCl, but not on mMRS agar supplemented with 6 % (w/v) NaCl.
Negative for nitrate and nitrite reduction, indole production, urease production, pyruvate utilization, hydrolysis of hippurate, gas production from glucose and catalase production.
The type strain is strain 47-3T (=NCIMB 15165T =CCM 8903T=LMG 31064T), isolated from traditional pickle in Heilongjiang Province, PR China. The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 50.9 mol%.
