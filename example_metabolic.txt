Cells are Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming rods, 0.8–1×1–2 µm, that usually occur singly, in pairs or in short chains. Colonies on mMRS agar are circular, with entire margins, smooth, convex, white and approximately 1 mm in diameter after 2 days incubation at 30 °C. Facultatively anaerobic. Can grow at 15–40 °C and pH 5–10. Can grow on mMRS agar supplemented with 5 % (w/v) NaCl, but not on mMRS agar supplemented with 6 % (w/v) NaCl. Negative for nitrate and nitrite reduction, indole production, urease production, pyruvate utilization, hydrolysis of hippurate, gas production from glucose and catalase production. Positive for tolerance to tellurite and Voges–Proskauer reaction. Arginine is not deaminated. Both isomers of lactic acid are produced (2 % d-lactate and 98 % l-lactate). Acid is produced from d-glucose, d-fructose, d-mannose, d-mannitol, N-acetylglucosamine, cellobiose and maltose. Acid is not produced from glycerol, erythritol, d-arabinose, l-arabinose, d-ribose, d-xylose, l-xylose, d-adonitol, methyl β-d-xylopyranoside, l-sorbose, l-rhamnose, dulcitol, inositol, d-sorbitol, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside, methyl α-d-glucopyranoside, amygdalin, arbutin, salicin, lactose, melibiose, sucrose, trehalose, inulin, melezitose, raffinose, starch, glycogen, xylitol, gentiobiose, turanose, d-lyxose, d-tagatose, d-fucose, l-fucose, d-arabitol, l-arabitol, gluconate, 2-keto-gluconate or 5-keto-gluconate. Aesculin is not hydrolysed. Cells do not contain meso-diaminopimelic acid in their cell-wall peptidoglycan, and the diagnostic diamino acid is lysine. H2S production and acid production from d-galactose are strain-dependent. C16 : 0, C18 : 1  ω9c, sum of C19 : 1  ω6c/C19 : 0 cyclo ω10c and sum of C18 : 1  ω6c/C18 : 1  ω7c are major fatty acids. The type strain is strain 47-3T (=NCIMB 15165T =CCM 8903T=LMG 31064T), isolated from traditional pickle in Heilongjiang Province, PR China. The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 50.9 mol%.
