#Formosa sp. nov strain Hel1_33_131 GH30 (FbGH30) removed the β-1,6-glucose side chains, and Formosa agariphila GH17A (FaGH17A) and FaGH16A hydrolyzed the β-1,3-glucose backbone of laminarin.

#These observations suggest that GH173 could act on β-linked galactosyl residues in pectic polysaccharides.

#In Bacteroidales bacterium UBA2817, a GH173 member is appended to a GH78 module carrying a CBM67, both targeting rhamnogalacturonans (Fig. 6b).

#The GH97 member (CapGH97) is a calcium-activated α-galactosidase, whereas the GH43 member (CapGH43_12) is a highly active α-L-arabinofuranosidase—two key activities to remove glycosidic substitutions of heteroxylans.

#Interestingly, we also identified in the PUL a new ulvan lyase (LOR_29) which showed no homology to previously reported ulvan lyases making it a founding member of yet another new family of polysaccharide lyases (PL25).
