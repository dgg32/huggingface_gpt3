Cells are Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, catalase-positive, aerobic and oxidase-negative coccobacilli. Colonies on TSA are circular, opaque, milky white and slightly convex. Optimum growth is at 28 °C, 1.5 % (w/v) NaCl and pH 7.0. Strains also grow on brain heart infusion agar and Columbia agar. Acid is produced from d-arabinose, cellobiose, d-fucose, d-galactose, d-glucose, lactose, maltose, d-mannose, melibiose, d-ribose, d-lyxose, d-xylose, gentiobiose, l-arabinose and l-rhamnose. Nitrate is not reduced. Strains assimilate acetate, β-alanine, ethanol and l-lactate but not l-arginine, citrate, gentisate, d-glucose, l-glutamate, l-histidine, l-leucine, l-phenylalanine or trigonelline. Hydrolysis reactions of gelatin and urea are negative. The major fatty acids are C18 : 1  ω9c, C16 : 0 and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1  ω7c/C16 : 1  ω6c). The main polar lipids are DPG, PE and PG. The predominant respiratory quinone is Q-9. Strain 187 is also classified in this species. The GenBank accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains 185T and 187 are MK990276 and MT140297, respectively. The GenBank accession numbers for the genome sequences of strains 185T and 187 are CP049916 and JAANID000000000, respectively.
