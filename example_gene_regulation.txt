We hypothesized that bmo-miR-275 has a potential regulatory function regarding the expression of sericin gene 2 (BmSer-2). First, we examined the expression of bmo-miR-275 and its target gene BmSer-2 in seven different tissues from 5th instar day-3 silkworm larvae. The results showed that they were both specifically expressed in the middle silk gland, implying that spatio-temporal conditions are required for bmo-miR-275 to regulate the expression of BmSer-2. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a pri-bmo-miR-275 expressing plasmid pcDNA3.0 [ie1-egfp-pri-bmo-miR-275-SV40] and BmSer-2-3Â´UTR recombinant reporter plasmids pGL3.0 [A3-luc-Ser-2-3' UTR-SV40]. Finally, BmN cells were harvested and luciferase activity was detected. Results showed that luciferase activity was reduced significantly (P<0.05) in BmN cells co-transfected with pcDNA3.0 [ie1-egfp-pri-bmo-miR-275-SV40] and pGL3.0 [A3-luc-Ser-2-3'UTR-SV40], suggesting that bmo-miR-275 can down-regulate the expression of BmSer-2 in vitro. Our results improve the understanding of the regulatory function of Bombyx mori miRNA on the expression of genes regulating silk formation.
